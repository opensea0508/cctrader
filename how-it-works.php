                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>Unlike full-service brokerages, discount brokers do not compete with their clients. We constantly assess the markets in which we operate to ensure that we conduct business in line with our strategy. </p>

                <p>A choice made internally by our organization not to provide retail trading for aspiring traders, however, as a firm that appreciates all our clients' needs, we will continue to educate our retail traders to the best of our ability.</p>

                <p>Wholesale clients (high-net-worth people and companies) who we believe can align business plans with ours are currently suitable for our services. To provide the finest trading experience, limit losses, and increase profits as a discount and Executional Broker, we work with our clients rather than against them. However, some clients do not match our strategy.</p>

                <p>For wholesale trading and execution (also known as B2B), we charge a portion of earnings as performance fees and management fees. Management fees are like swap fees on the retail level because they are charged based on the amount of trading done.</p>


                <p>A limited Power of Attorney is necessary when you register with us, as well as a mandatory KYC and Risk closure agreement. After reviewing your application, our compliance team will send you an acceptance email or letter, if you meet our client eligibility requirement. We will also send you an email or letter rejecting the opportunity to work with us, if in the case you did not meet our client eligibility standard, we will inform you of our decision in a timely manner. Before taking on a new client, we look at a variety of factors, such as their degree of experience, financial resources, and investing goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                For us, trading is a high-risk activity, we pay attention when onboarding new clients. Each client bears its own risk because there is no joint risk. In neither case do we combine your money with those of another client nor do we add your funds to our own fund. Under no circumstance will our company be liable to any client for their losses or damage caused by investing in CFDs and Fx trading. We strongly recommend our client read our risk disclosure agreement.
                </p>
