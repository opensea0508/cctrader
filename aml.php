                            Money laundering is the act of converting money or other monetary instruments gained from illegal activity into money or investments that appear to be legitimate so that its illegal source cannot be traced. There are domestic and international laws that apply to companies whose customers can deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts.

                            CCI Traders or its legal affiliate, CCI Trading Limited, strictly follows the provisions of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing policy and demands that its employees fully observe these standards. The company therefore takes all necessary measures to detect and counter money laundering and terrorism financing. The internal rules are observed in accordance with the relevant international requirements.

                            The objective of the anti-money laundering procedures that CCI Traders implements is to ensure that customers engaging in certain activities are identified to a reasonable standard while minimising the compliance burden and impact on legitimate customers. CCI Traders is committed to assisting governments combat the threat of money laundering and financing terrorist activities around the world. For that purpose, CCI Traders has set up a highly sophisticated electronic system. This system documents and verifies client identification records, tracks all transactions, and maintains detailed records of all transactions.
                            CCI Traders carefully tracks suspicious and significant transaction activities and reports such activities "providing timely and comprehensive information" to law enforcement bodies. To uphold the integrity of reporting systems and to safeguard businesses, the legislative framework provides legal protection to providers of such information.
                            In order to minimise the risk of money laundering and financing terrorist activities, we neither accept nor disburse cash under any circumstances. We also reserve the right to refuse to process a transfer at any stage if we believe the transfer to be connected in any way to money laundering or criminal activity. It is forbidden for CCI Traders or its legal affiliates to inform customers that they have been reported for suspicious activity.

                            To complying with anti-money laundering laws, CCI Traders will require two or more different documents to verify the identity of the customer. The first document we require is a legal, government-issued, identifying document with the customer's picture on it. It may be a government-issued passport, driver's licence (for countries where the driver's licence is a primary identification document), or local ID card (no company access cards). The second document we require is a bill with the customer's own name and actual address on it, issued three months ago at the earliest. It may be a utility bill, a bank statement, an affidavit, or any other document with the customer’s name and address from an internationally recognised organization.
                            To change the phone number and address related to the client profile, clients are required to provide a document confirming ownership of a new phone number (an agreement with a mobile phone service provider) and a photo of the ID held beside the client’s face. The client’s personal data shall be the same in both documents. Clients also required to send his or her Proof of news address which was modified or change.
                            Clients are required to submit up-to-date identification and contact information in a timely manner, as soon as changes occur.
                            Documents in non-Western languages must be translated into English by an official translator; the translation must be stamped and signed by the translator and sent together with the original document with a clear picture of the customer on it.
